Other printed parts for Ormerod
===============================

This folder contains designs for the following printed parts, that are for the Ormerod but not for the sensor board:

1. PSU enclosure: this is an enclosure to cover the mains wiring and output wiring of a 12V 300W power supply sourced from eBay UK (http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UK-Stock-DC-12V-Universal-Regulated-Switching-Power-Supply-for-LED-Strip-CCTV-/161081134308?pt=UK_BOI_Electrical_Test_Measurement_Equipment_ET&var=&hash=item25812f0ce4). This replaces the ATX PSU supplied with the kit and supplies a more stable and adjustable 12V supply, which is useful when printing ABS. It accommodates a snap-in IEC mains inlet with switch and fuse, a neon indicator, and a 20A locking connector for the 12V output. All of these can be sourced from Maplin Electronics or from the usual component distributors.

2. Spacers for Matt's y-belt fastening posts. Y-belt slippage is a common problem with Ormerods, and Matt's y-belt mounts solve the problem. However, getting the y-belt tension right can be tricky because the y-belt length can only be adjusted in multiples of a whole tooth. One solution is to print Matt's y-belt tensioning device too. A simpler solution is to print these spacers to slip under the y-belt posts before tightening the mounting screws. There are 3 different thicknesses of spacer in this print, which can be used individually or in combination to get the right y-belt tension.

3. Fan inlet duct and finger guard. This is a variation on the fan inlet duct by Andy (kwikius), designed for the 7-bladed fan shipped with some Ormerod kits, and thin enough to allow the print head to slide past the Duet electronics enclosure in its normal position.
