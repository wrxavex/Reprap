Printed parts to go with Ormerod sensor board
=============================================

To use the Ormerod sensor board you will need to print three parts:

1. Modified x-motor bracket. This includes an extended x-homing tab to suit the new position of the IR sensor head. Not needed if you use a microswitch for x-homing instead.

2. Modified heatsink duct. This includes the mounting points for the sensor board. Alternatively you can use Matt's one-piece hotend duct. His files are here:

3. Insulator. This prevents the board from shorting against the z-threaded rod or other metal parts if the print head moves beyond the intended x-homing position. Alternatively you can use Kim brown's safety cover, his files are http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:272634 for kit 2/3/4, and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:273055 for kits 4+ and 5.

The other parts in this folder are:

4. Board holder. This can be fixed to the back of a solder stencil, allowing boards to be accurately aligned with the stencil prior to application of solder paste.

Many thanks to johneato for producing the STLs for the modified x-motor bracket and modified heatsink duct.
